# 🚀 ALX Django Learn Lab

This is my personal Django practice lab — part of my journey as a backend developer through the ALX Software Engineering Program. It contains basic exercises as I explore Django from setup to app creation.

This repository includes Django project setup, first app creation and configuration, understanding of project structure, and practical use of `manage.py` and the development server.

I am working with tools like Python 3, Django, and Git & GitHub.

My learning roadmap includes setting up the Django project, creating the first app, exploring models and migrations, and soon starting API development with Django REST Framework.

The project structure looks like this:

Alx_DjangoLearnLab/
├── LibrayProject/
│ ├── manage.py
│ └── LibrayProject/
└── README.md


I am Ulrich Armel Dahyebga. You can find me on GitHub [@Ulricharmel001](https://github.com/Ulricharmel001) and LinkedIn [Ulricharmel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ulricharmel).
